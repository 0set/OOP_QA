OOP Lecture9
Virtual Function
background
previously in the case of upcasting, the compilier will execute the function of the base class, not the derived class
reason: Previous problem: using early binding, compiler cannot know the “correct” function to call. Therefore, we need late binding who binds during the run time. And the virtual function in the base class enables late binding. Late binding enables polymorphism.

mention:it only works for pointers and references
grammar

the virtual keyword is only needed in declaration, not in definition
