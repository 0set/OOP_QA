## SimpleNES https://github.com/amhndu/SimpleNES

This project provides a simple NES emulator written in C++. You can run some classic Nintendo games like SuperMarioBros with this NES.

I recommend this project because of both its simplicity and profundity. This project includes only less than 30 files, each of which has no more than 1000 lines of codes, which is very suitable for C++ beginners. Despite its simplicity, we can learn a lot about computer system architeture, which is really important for cs majors, including how CPU executes instructions, how the memory is allocated and so on.
